	I'm a software engineer living in San Diego, CA who likes to surf, spend time with my three dogs,
	and sometimes see how far I can run.
</p>

<p>
	I'm currently working on internal tooling at Housecall Pro and building web3 tools for music
	artists at Mint Songs.

<p>
	I'm interested in the intersection between humans and technology and believe software should be
	built for people to use, not just machines to consume.
