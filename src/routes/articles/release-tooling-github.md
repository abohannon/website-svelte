Maintaining a repo, especially one with many contributors, can quickly become overwhelming and disorganized. Though we weren't quite there, a repo I maintain at work was rapidly approaching that cliff so I made a small change to our tooling to strengthen our workflow, improve documentation and generally make our lives easier going forward as the project grows and more engineers inevitably join the project. Fortunately the changes are very easy to make. It should only take you 5-10 minutes.

To handle these problems, I added the following GitHub actions to our repo:

1. [Release Drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter)
2. [PR Labeler](https://github.com/TimonVS/pr-labeler-action)

Prior to adding these actions, we were releasing manually and trying to organize PRs by naming conventions in the title. This has limitations for multiple reasons.

First, releasing manually is tedious and repetitive which means it should probably be automated.

Second, it's prone to human error and laziness. I'll be the first to admit I've written poor release notes because I was busy or distracted. Another reason to automate. This second point can also apply to version bumping. We loosely follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and probably bump versions inconsistently. At the end of the day, maybe this isn't a huge deal. It's really not for our project but, in the spirit of well-organized software, it's something I wanted to nail down. That's also another great feature of Release Drafter, you can automate version bumping based on PR labels.

Third, relying on organizing PRs by manual naming conventions in the title suffers from these first two problems. It's repetitive and not everyone remembers to do it the same way so it makes the PR view and logs messy. It's also difficult at first glance to get a snapshot of what's currently being worked on. With labels (and if you use different colors like we do), this becomes easier.

## PR Labeler Setup

We'll start with PR Labeler which automatically labels your PRs based on a config.

1. Create and checkout a branch called `feature/pr-labeler` (this name will come in handy later)
2. Create the folder `.github` in your project's root directory
3. Add a subfolder inside named `workflows`
4. Create a file named `pr-labeler.yml` and paste the following config inside (checkout [the repo](https://github.com/TimonVS/pr-labeler-action) if you have additional questions beyond these instructions)

   ```yml
   name: PR Labeler
   on:
     pull_request:
       types: [opened]

   jobs:
     pr-labeler:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: TimonVS/pr-labeler-action@v3
           with:
             configuration-path: .github/pr-labeler.yml # optional, .github/pr-labeler.yml is the default value
           env:
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

5. In the `.github` root directory (not inside `workflows`) add another filed named `pr-labeler.yml` and paste the following as a boiler plate.

   ```yml
   feature: ["feature/*", "feat/*"]
   bugfix: ["fix/*", "bugfix/*"]
   style: style/*
   documentation: docs/*
   performance: ["perf/*", "performance/*"]
   refactor: refactor/*
   test: ["test/*", "testing/*"]
   build: build/*
   improvement: improvement/*
   chore: chore/*
   ```

   This configuration is for our repo at work, but the syntax is `<label name>: <branch name>`. The glob `*` at the end indicates that anything after the `/` should match.

   Feel free to change this according to your needs, but for the sake of this tutorial please keep

   ```
   feature: ["feature/*", "feat/*"]
   ```

6. Add PR labels in GitHub to match your config (if you don't have them yet)

   For the sake of this tutorial, if you don't have a "feature" label, please create one.

   ![Labels View](./pr-labeler-2.png)

7. Commit, push, and open a PR for your branch

   Now GitHub will see the files you added in the `.github` directory, install the action, and run it. If you click on "Actions" in your repo's top navigation, you can see the action working. This page will show a history of all your actions complete with logs if something goes wrong.

   Once the action completes and (hopefully) is successful, head over to your PR view and you should see your PR with the label "feature" next to it. Congrats, you've successfully automated PR labeling!

   I added PR Labeler to my website repo while working on this blog. Here you can see my PR was automatically labeled "blog" because my branch name is `blog/release-tooling` and my yml config includes `blog: blog/*`.

## Release Drafter Setup

The Release Drafter setup is very similar to the steps we just went through.

1. If you followed the steps for PR Labeler above, create a branch that includes a label from your repo
2. In the `.github/workflows` directory you created, create a file named `draft.yml` and paste the following

   ```yml
   name: Release Drafter

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - master # your production branch

   jobs:
     update_release_draft:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: release-drafter/release-drafter@master
           env:
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

3. In the `.github` root directory, create a file named `release-drafter.yml` and paste the following starter config. (Remember to checkout [the Release Drafter repo](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) for more configuration options.)

   ```yml
   name-template: "v$RESOLVED_VERSION"
   tag-template: "v$RESOLVED_VERSION"
   categories:
     - title: "‚ö† Breaking Changes"
       label: "breaking change"
     - title: "üöÄ Features"
       label: "feature"
     - title: "üòé Refactor"
       label: "refactor"
     - title: "üöÖ Performance"
       label: "performance"
     - title: "üêõ Bug Fixes"
       label: "bugfix"
     - title: "üß∞ Maintenance"
       labels:
         - "chore"
         - "build"
     - title: "üß™ Tests"
       labels:
         - "test"
         - "testing"
         - "tests"
     - title: "üåà Style"
       label: "style"
     - title: "üìï Documentation"
       label: "documentation"
   change-template: "- $TITLE @$AUTHOR (#$NUMBER)"
   change-title-escapes: '\<*_&' # You can add # and @ to disable mentions, and add ` to disable code blocks.
   version-resolver:
     major:
       labels:
         - "major"
         - "breaking change"
     minor:
       labels:
         - "minor"
         - "feature"
     patch:
       labels:
         - "patch"
         - "bugfix"
         - "test"
         - "documentation"
         - "style"
         - "chore"
         - "build"
     default: patch
   template: |
     $CHANGES
   ```

   This config determines what the release draft will look like. This is what we use at work and it creates a release that looks like this:

   ![Release](./release.png)

   You will likely want to modify this to your repo's needs. It should be straightforward on how to add/remove titles and labels.

   The section titled `version-resolver` is the config that automatically bumps your release version. You can see that only PRs labeled with "major" or "breaking change" indicate a major release for us, while "minor" and "feature" indicate a minor release, and the rest indicate a patch release. You can (and probably should) leave some labels out of this config, or create one specifically called something like "hide from changelog", for changes that don't amount to anything significant enough to warrant a version bump.

   Note the `name-template` and `tag-template` properties at the top.

   ```yml
   name-template: "v$RESOLVED_VERSION"
   tag-template: "v$RESOLVED_VERSION"
   ```

   This should match your current release formatting (if you've released before). For example, this format matches releases with titles and tags in the format of `v1.0.0`. If you don't prepend with "v", remove it here. Or you might prepend with "Release", then replace "v" with "Release ".

4. Commit, push, and open a PR for this branch

   PR Labeler will start working to label this PR if you installed it with the steps above. If not, manually add a label to your PR that matches one of the labels in `release-drafter.yml` above, like "feature".

5. If you haven't released before, create a manual release. If you have released before, skip to the next step.

   Release Drafter's `name-template` needs to match the format of your existing releases to successfully bump your version. If you haven't released yet, there's nothing to match.

   From your repo's main view, click "Create new release" in the right sidebar

   ![Create new release](./release-2.png)

   Enter `v1.0.0` in both the tag version and title and click "Publish Release".

   Note: You're not required to use this format. Whatever format you use, make sure it's reflected in the `name-template` and `tag-template` properties in your Release Drafter template config.

   ![New release](./release-3.png)

6. Merge your PR into `master`

   If you visit the "Actions" tab, you should see Release Drafter working. Once it's finished (takes about 1 minute for me), head back to your Releases view (`<username>/<repo name>/releases` if you've lost track of it) and you should see the new release draft with your PR categorized under the header that matches your PR label and a version bump that coincides with your version resolver config in `release-drafter.yml`.

   To publish the release, click on "Edit" next to the release, make any changes or add any comments you'd like, and click "Publish release"

   And there you go. You have now automated your release workflow!
